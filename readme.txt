MoreFoods - Adds more foods and food aging


time to age one stage = (1.0 / chance ) * interval * delay

The default chance is 0.164 with an interval of 5 minutes and 5 delay cycles per stage, resulting in about one stage every 2.5 hours. A food with 4 stages and 5 delay cycles each would take about 10 hours to fully age and rot. There is a 1 in 6 random chance for a food item to age every 5 minutes.
